The ASCII art diagram is helpful too for remembering how slices work:

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | P | y | t | h | o | n |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
    
One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing *between* characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of *n* characters has index *n*.


```python
a[start:end] # items start through end-1
a[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array
a[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1
a[:]         # a copy of the whole array
```

There is also the `step` value, which can be used with any of the above:

```python
a[start:end:step] # start through not past end, by step
```

The key point to remember is that the `:end` value represents the first value that is *not* in the selected slice. So, the difference beween `end` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).

The other feature is that `start` or `end` may be a *negative* number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:

```python
a[-1]    # last item in the array
a[-2:]   # last two items in the array
a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items
```

Python is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for `a[:-2]` and `a` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.
