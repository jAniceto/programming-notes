## Variables 

There are three main keywords used to define variables in JavaScript:
- `const`: defines a constant variable that cannot be redefined later
- `let`: defines a variable is local to the scope of the innermost pair of curly braces surrounding it
- `var`: defines a variable that is local to the function it is defined in

Here is an example showcasing these different ways to define variables:

```javascript
// This variable exists even outside the loop
if (true) {
    var message = 'Hello!';
}

alert(message);
```

Because `var` was used to define message, there will be no errors running this code.

```javascript
// This variable does not exist outside the loop
if (true) {
    let message = 'Hello!';
}

alert(message);
```

Because `let` was used to define message, it cannot be passed to alert, which is outside the scope of message. If this were in an HTML page, when the page was opened, no alert would pop up. If the console were opened in the browser, there would be an `Uncaught ReferenceError`.

```javascript
// The value of const variables cannot change
const message = 'Hello!';
message = 'Goodbye!';

alert(message);
```
  
Similar to the last example, no alert will pop up. In the console, there would be an `Uncaught TypeError`, since there was an attempt to redefine a variable defined with `const`.

## Template literals (formatting strings)

```javascript
const name = 'Daniel';

alert(`Hello ${name}!`);
```


## Arrow functions

Since functions, especially anonymous functions, are so common in JavaScript, ES6 has introduced a new syntax for functions called arrow notation that allows for the definition of so-called arrow functions.

```javascript
() => {
    alert('Hello, world!');
}

x => {
    alert(x);
}

x => x * 2;
```

An arrow function is defined without using the word function, but rather just with a pair of parentheses enclosing any arguments the function takes, followed by an arrow, and finally the function body, enclosed in curly braces. Functions with only one argument can be defined without the use of parentheses enclosing the argument list. Functions that have only one line in the body can drop the curly braces and have the body on the same line as the argument list and arrow. Here's an example:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Have each button change the color of the heading
    document.querySelectorAll('.color-change').forEach(button => {
        button.onclick = () => {
            document.querySelector('#hello').style.color = button.dataset.color;
        };
    });
});
```
