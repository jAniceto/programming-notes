When you need to host your projects, you have several options available:

**Shared hosting**, where you share a server with lots of other users and have very limited control over the server. **Dedicated hosting**, where you have complete control over a server, a very flexible option, but requires you to manage the whole server, worry about hardware failures and backups, and is typically expensive. A third option that is in between these two choices is a **Virtual Private Server**, or **VPS**.

VPSs virtualized nature provides several advantages such as instant reinstallation of the operating system, quick recovery and backup, and fast and simple hardware upgrades (the hardware is virtual, after all).

Here is a list of several popular VPS providers:
