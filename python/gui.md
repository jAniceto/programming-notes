# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in Python

### For simple command line programs

- [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) - Turn (almost) any Python command line program into a full GUI application


### GUI libraries

- [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) - Python's de-facto standard GUI available in the standard library

- [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Transforms tkinter, Qt, Remi, WxPython into portable people-friendly Pythonic interfaces. Easy for beginners, not really recommended for production ready app.

- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) - Cross-platform GUI library supporting both desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices (Android, iOS).

- [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro), [QtPy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/), [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide) - There are Python bindings available for the Qt toolkit (using either PyQt or PySide). PyQt is currently more mature than PySide, but you must buy a PyQt license if you want to write proprietary applications. PySide is free for all applications.

- [DearPyGUI](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) - Has nice documentation, good tutorial made by dev himself, loaded with features but frequent updates change the functionality sometimes. Built with Dear ImGui.

- [WX-Python](https://www.wxpython.org/#) - Hasn't been updated in a while.

- [Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga) - Still in beta.

### Other

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/docs/) - Makes it easy to build beautiful apps for machine learning.
